- Prefer reactive refs over reactive objects

### CSS/Styling

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes

- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)

### Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` before committing
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
